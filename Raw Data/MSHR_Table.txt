The Master Station History Report is a listing of the more than 50,000 stations documented in the NCDC Station History 
Database. They are located on all continents but most are US sites. It contains information about the present 
and historical names, identifiers, and locations. Due to the inclusion of historical changes in the reported fields, 
a given station may have dozens of records, one being created for every time period in which some reported component of 
a station changed.

The file is sorted by the NCDC Station ID and then by period of record.

This report is scheduled to be updated monthly.

The first record of this report product data set contains the date the report was created.
